# SPA's: the good, the bad & the ugly

## The good
+ Fluid user experience, when a lot of user interactions are needed
+ More control over what part needs to show new info
+ Faster to update one part than reload the entire page

A SPA is very useful when the user interacts a lot with the page. Parts can be reloaded because of a change of state instead of having to reload the entire page.

## The bad
+ Slower on initial load, because loading in framework prior to rendering page
+ Navigating, the browser doesn't know that the user is on the 'next' page
+ SEO on smaller search engines, Google for instance can search SPA's and MPA's just fine

Before choosing for a SPA the developers should realize that a SPA has it's downsides. These need to be discussed before making a decision.

## The ugly
+ Converting a MPA to a SPA can require a lot of knowledge, time and money.

When the development team has made a choice it's not all fun and games. When the app is an existing app you have to keep in mind that you will spend a lot of time in rebuilding the MPA to a SPA. It may not be the best solution if a SPA is not needed but nice to have.

## Conclusion
SPA's have their pros and cons, as addressed above. The type of interaction a user will have influences the decision for it immensely. When you address the cons accordingly, you will greatly enhance the user experience of your app.
