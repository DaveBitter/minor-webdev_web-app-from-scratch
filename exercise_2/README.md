# jQuery: the good, the bad & the ugly

## The good
+ Painless DOM manipulation
+ Easy basic animations
+ Open Source
+ Plug-ins

It's easy and saves a lot of time to use jQuery in your project. You can use the knowledge of others as a base for your code in the form of functions, examples and plug-ins. It's quick and it's easy.

## The bad
+ Open source, not built to a common standard
+ Latest stable version is from 2012
+ Multiple versions out, browser compatibility
+ Misusing POST instead of GET

There are a lot of pitfalls with using jQuery. To make sure that you don't fall into those you need to stay on top of the development of jQuery. Furthermore, you should understand the thing that it replaces. The example given is the difference between a POST and a GET. Misusage will bite you in the bum.

## The ugly
+ Speed
+ Spaghetti code

Multiple DOM manipulations slows down you website. This is especially bad in big production environments where every second counts. Due to all the selectors and jQuery code the file can become a nightmare to work in. This especially happens when you don't understand the JavaScript behind jQuery. The 'copy-paste' mentality makes the files unnecessarily long.

## Conclusion
When you fully understand the basic ways of accomplishing what libraries like jQuery do, there's no problem with using them. When you don't, problems can arise. It's also a good idea to check how well a library is documented and supported before relying on it in a project.
